# OptiPack

OptiPack is Minecraft 1.19.2 Optimization and QOL mods Modpack for Fabric with its own installer (soon to be released as standalone cuztomizable with more cool features for everyone)

# Installation

As for now you only need to download and execute "installer.bat". This will download all requied files and apps (If you dont have added 7z to PATH it will do it for you)

# FAQ (F = May get, lmao)

- Can i edit it for my modpack? -
Yes you can but i would prefer wait for standalone release, it will make it easier for everyone. (i mean bugs, errors etc.)
- Is it safe? -
Yes, if you dont belive read code.
- Why are cheats stored in installer files? -
Currently they're not but will be because one of the cheats doesnt support 1.19.2 natively, i had to manually edit jar file to allow 1.19.2 to load it.
- Can you make version for 1.xx.x? -
Maybe, i dont play versions below 1.16.5.
- Why 1.19.2 not 1.19.3? -
Because i dont like 1.19.3 lol.
- Why is this written in batch?
Because its easy and i know enough about it to make smth with it.
